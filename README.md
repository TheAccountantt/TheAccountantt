# Hi, I'm Fernando 👋

**Management Accountant | Finance Automation Builder | ICAEW Finalist**

I'm a finance professional who writes code to solve real business problems. With a first-class degree in Accounting & Finance and currently completing my ACA qualification, I specialise in building Python automation tools for finance teams connecting systems, eliminating manual work, and turning hours of spreadsheet wrangling into one-click processes.

> ⚡ Fun fact: I've automated processes that save around 3 hours daily (at least) for the finance team proving accountants can code!
