- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheAccountantt
- 👀 I’m not a developer, but I am interested in accounting and finance programing related tools that help professionals in their fields to automate tasks and analyse data
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to leverage different tools (including GitHub) to expand my basic knowledge of Python as well as other programing languages
- 💞️ Open to colaborations on related accounting and finance projects or anything interesting
